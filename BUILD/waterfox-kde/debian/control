Description: Free, open and private browser with openSUSE's patches for better integration with KDE
 Waterfox focuses on giving users choice while also helping make the world a better place. Watefox is partners with Ecosia, a search engine that plants trees with its generated revenues. The browser itself is focused on power users, which lets you make the important decisions. There is no plugin whitelist, you can run whichever extensions you like and absolutely no data or telemetry is sent back to Mozilla or the Waterfox project.
 .
 Waterfox is powered by Mozilla Firefox source code.

 Note: Language packs are available as separate packages!
