waterfox-kde (56.2.10-0) obs; urgency=medium
    * Latest security fixes up to Firefox ESR 60.7
    * Added new Mozilla certificates to be able to install add-ons from AMO again
    * Waterfox now identifies as Waterfox once again!

        - This fixes issues with repeat CAPTCHAs, hooray!
        - Websites that require a vanilla Firefox user agent will get one, so far: web.whatsapp.com, amazon.*, netflix.com, chase.com. Please request if a website you visit doesnâ€™t recognise the Waterfox user agent.
        - This should stop YouTube from doing A/B tests that break on Waterfox.
